                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Featureban is a simple, fun and highly customisable kanban simulation game.
                    Since its creation in 2019 it has been used by trainers and coaches in Lean, Agile and
                    Kanban-Related events the world over.

                    The game starts simple with visual management(iteration 1 ); after taht we layer on things like WIP
                    limits
                    (iteration 2 ) and metrics (iteration 3). This incremental approach is very much by design and you
                    are free to introduce your
                    own elements in a similar fashion
